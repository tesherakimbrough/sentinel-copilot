# Sentinel Copilot

**Sentinel Copilot** is a security log analysis tool designed to help you turn raw CSV logs into meaningful insights‚Äîfast. Upload your logs, explore interactive visualizations, and get instant summaries that help you spot trends or suspicious activity.

Try it live: [sentinel-copilot.streamlit.app](https://sentinel-copilot.streamlit.app/)

## Why I Built This

I work in security analysis and I‚Äôm teaching myself software engineering. After spending too many hours buried in log files, I wanted a tool that‚Äôs quick, visual, and actually useful‚Äîno advanced degree needed. Sentinel Copilot is my solution: upload a file, get results, and get on with your day. With built-in anomaly detection powered by real machine learning, Sentinel Copilot helps you catch the log entries that matter most‚Äîeven those traditional dashboards miss.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tesherakimbrough/sentinel-copilot.git
    cd sentinel-copilot
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    >If you want to use machine learning features, scikit-learn is required and already included in requirements.txt

3. **Run the app**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app/main.py
    ```

Or try it instantly on the [live Streamlit demo](https://sentinel-copilot.streamlit.app/).

## What Makes Sentinel Copilot Different?

If you‚Äôre tired of one-size-fits-all tools, Sentinel Copilot is built for fast, real-world insights:

- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle:** Pick your favorite theme for comfort.
- **Interactive Filtering:** Search, sort, and filter logs by IP, event type, date, or keywords.
- **Visual Summaries:** Instant charts for event frequency, source IP activity, and more.
- üß† **Real-time anomaly detection:** Machine learning (Isolation Forest) flags suspicious log events automatically‚Äîno keys or cloud required.
- **Downloadable Reports:** Export summaries or filtered logs as CSV with one click.
- **No AI Hype‚ÄîJust Useful Automation:** Mock ‚ÄúAI summary‚Äù is built in, and it‚Äôs ready for plug-and-play with OpenAI if you want to add GPT-based analysis later.
- **Open Source & Easy to Extend:** Clean codebase and modular structure. Fork away.

## What‚Äôs Next?

- Plug in OpenAI for true LLM-based summaries
- Support for more log formats (JSON, syslog, etc.)
- User authentication for team use

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Works on Windows, macOS, or Linux

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Streamlit not found:**  
  Make sure you installed all requirements:  
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- **Port already in use:**  
  If you get an error about a port conflict, stop other Streamlit apps or change the port with:  
  `streamlit run app/main.py --server.port 8502`

- **Issues with plots or CSV files:**  
  Double-check your CSV format matches the sample. Supported columns: `timestamp`, `source_ip`, `event_type`.
